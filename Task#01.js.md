NFT Metadata Retrieval and Storage:

The Challenge: Create an API endpoint that accepts an NFT contract address and token ID. It should retrieve the metadata (name, description, image URL) from the blockchain using web3.js, store it in MongoDB, and return the metadata to the user.
Focus: Demonstrates understanding of web3.js interaction with smart contracts, handling data from blockchain, and basic database integration.
